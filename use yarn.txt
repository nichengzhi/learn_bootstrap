Grid Classes
The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:

xs (for phones - screens less than 768px wide)
sm (for tablets - screens equal to or greater than 768px wide)
md (for small laptops - screens equal to or greater than 992px wide)
lg (for laptops and desktops - screens equal to or greater than 1200px wide)
The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.

Tip: Each class scales up, so if you wish to set the same widths for xs and sm, you only need to specify xs. 

Grid System Rules
Some Bootstrap grid system rules:

Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding
Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns
Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows
Predefined classes like .row and .col-sm-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts
Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows
Grid columns are created by specifying the number of 12 available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-sm-4
Column widths are in percentage, so they are always fluid and sized relative to their parent element
